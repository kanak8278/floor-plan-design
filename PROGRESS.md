# Progress log

One line per verified step. Newest last.

- Probed ResPlan (17k plans): 99.75% axis-aligned edges, rooms tile `inner` (overlap ~0%), doors are wall-thickness strips.
- Found wall-mass skeletonisation FAILS (median rebuild IoU 0.37); room-tiling inversion works instead.
- Wrote canonical IR (integer mm, wall centrelines, parametric openings, derived room faces).
- Wrote ResPlan -> IR converter and IR <-> OpenPlan3D Project adapter.
- Verified 300 plans: 100% IR->Project->IR identity, 99.9% openings hosted, 4.2 ms/plan.
- Verified with OpenPlan3D's real TS detectRooms on 200 converted Projects: 0 crashes, 88.5% exact room count, 98.5% within +/-1, per-room area error median 0.000% / p90 0.62%.
- VERDICT: ResPlan is a usable evaluation corpus. Proceed to build.
- Vendored OpenPlan3D source into `vendor/openPlan3D/` (MIT, upstream abb5267, .git stripped so it is versioned as our fork).
- Vendored ResPlan into `data/` (ResPlan.pkl gitignored at 246MB; utils/split/manifest tracked). TODO: switch code paths from /tmp to data/ once agents finish.
- Audited OpenPlan3D docs: FEATURES.md understates the code, BUG_REPORT's "room detection fundamentally limited" is STALE (T-junction splitting now present; measured 88.5% exact). Trust code + measurements, not the repo's docs.
- Found ElevationView.svelte (498 lines) and PrintLayout.svelte (372) — elevations and print layout DO exist, correcting my earlier read.
